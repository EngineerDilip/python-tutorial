## Introduction to OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data (objects) rather than functions and logic. Objects are instances of classes, which can hold both data (attributes) and functionality (methods). OOP in Python allows for modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

---

## Key Concepts of OOP

### 1. Class and Object

- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. A class defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects of the class will have.
- **Object**: An instance of a class. Objects can hold data in the form of attributes and provide functionality using methods.

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

    def drive(self):
        print(f"The {self.make} {self.model} is driving.")

# Creating an object
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
my_car.drive()
```
In Python, attributes and methods can have different levels of accessibility, though Python doesn’t have strict access control keywords like private, protected, and public in other languages (e.g., Java or C++). Instead, Python relies on naming conventions to indicate the intended visibility and accessibility of class attributes and methods. Here’s how Python handles private, protected, and public attributes and methods:

1. Public Attributes and Methods
Definition: These are accessible from anywhere, both inside and outside the class.
Naming Convention: No leading underscores.
Example:

```python

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Public attribute
        self.age = age    # Public attribute

    def display_info(self):  # Public method
        return f"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}"

emp = Employee("John", 30)
print(emp.name)              # Accessible
print(emp.display_info())     # Accessible
```

2. Protected Attributes and Methods
   
Definition: These are intended for internal use within the class and its subclasses. They can still be accessed from outside the class but should be treated as internal.

Naming Convention: A single leading underscore (_attribute or _method) suggests that the attribute or method is protected.

Example:
```python

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self._name = name  # Protected attribute
        self._age = age    # Protected attribute

    def _display_info(self):  # Protected method
        return f"Name: {self._name}, Age: {self._age}"

emp = Employee("John", 30)
print(emp._name)            # Accessible, but not recommended
print(emp._display_info())  # Accessible, but should be avoided
```

Even though _name and _display_info() can be accessed from outside, their single underscore indicates that they are internal to the class and should not be accessed directly in most cases.

1. Private Attributes and Methods
   
Definition: Private attributes and methods are meant to be accessible only within the class itself, and Python enforces this through name mangling.

Naming Convention: A double leading underscore (__attribute or __method) makes an attribute or method private. Python uses name mangling to make it harder (but not impossible) to access these from outside the class.
Example:
```python

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.__name = name  # Private attribute
        self.__age = age    # Private attribute

    def __display_info(self):  # Private method
        return f"Name: {self.__name}, Age: {self.__age}"

emp = Employee("John", 30)
# print(emp.__name)            # Raises AttributeError
# print(emp.__display_info())  # Raises AttributeError
```
However, private attributes can still be accessed by using Python's name mangling convention:

```python

print(emp._Employee__name)  # Accessing private attribute
print(emp._Employee__display_info())  # Accessing private method
```

This works, but should be avoided as it breaks encapsulation.

Summary Table

|Access Level| Naming Convention|Accessible From Outside Class?| Intended Use|
|-------------|-----------------|------------------|-----|
|Public| attribute|	Yes|	General| use|
|Protected|	_attribute|	Yes (but discouraged)|	Internal use (within class and subclasses)|
|Private|	__attribute|	No (but accessible via name mangling)|	Strictly internal use (only within the class)|
---

**Best Practices**

- Use public attributes for general information that’s okay to expose.
- Use protected attributes (_attribute) when you want to indicate that something is internal but don’t want to enforce strict access control.
- Use private attributes (__attribute) when you want to strongly signal that an attribute should not be accessed directly.

#### 1.2 Property Decorators and Getters/Setters
Python provides a convenient way to define getters and setters using the @property decorator, which helps manage access to class attributes without directly exposing the internal representation.
```python

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        self._name = name
        self._salary = salary

    @property
    def salary(self):
        return self._salary

    @salary.setter
    def salary(self, value):
        if value < 0:
            raise ValueError("Salary can't be negative")
        self._salary = value

emp = Employee("John", 5000)
print(emp.salary)  # Getter
emp.salary = 6000  # Setter
print(emp.salary)
```

#### 1.3 Static methods and class methods 

- Allow you to define methods that are related to the class, but don’t operate on instance-level data. They are defined with @staticmethod and @classmethod, respectively.

```python

class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def static_method():
        print("This is a static method")

    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):
        print(f"This is a class method, and the class is {cls}")

MyClass.static_method()
MyClass.class_method()
```

**Key Differences:**

| **Feature**               | **Instance Method**                    | **Class Method**                        | **Static Method**                       |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Bound to**               | Instance                               | Class                                   | Neither instance nor class              |
| **First parameter**        | `self` (instance)                      | `cls` (class)                           | No special first parameter              |
| **Can modify instance?**   | Yes (via `self`)                       | No                                      | No                                      |
| **Can modify class?**      | Yes                                    | Yes (via `cls`)                         | No                                      |
| **Decorator**              | None                                   | `@classmethod`                          | `@staticmethod`                         |
| **Called by**              | Instance                               | Class (or instance)                     | Class (or instance)                     |
| **Typical use case**       | Access or modify instance data         | Modify class-level data, factory methods | Utility functions that logically belong to the class |

---

#### 1.4 Operator Overloading (Dunder Methods)
- Python allows you to override or overload operators to give them new meaning in user-defined classes. This is done using dunder (double underscore) methods like __add__, __lt__, __eq__, etc.

```python

class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Point({self.x}, {self.y})"

p1 = Point(1, 2)
p2 = Point(3, 4)
p3 = p1 + p2
print(p3)  # Output: Point(4, 6)
```
### 2. Encapsulation

Encapsulation refers to bundling data and methods that work on the data within a single unit, such as a class. It restricts access to certain components by making attributes private.

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.__balance += amount

    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

# Accessing balance through methods, not directly
account = BankAccount(1000)
account.deposit(500)
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1500
```

### 3. Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. This promotes code reuse.

```python
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        print("This animal makes a sound.")

class Dog(Animal):  # Inheriting from Animal class
    def sound(self):
        print("The dog barks.")

my_dog = Dog()
my_dog.sound()  # Output: The dog barks.
```

#### 3.1 Multiple Inheritance
- Python allows a class to inherit from multiple classes, which is not possible in some other languages like Java.
```python
class Base1:
    def __init__(self):
        self.str1 = "Base1"
        print("Base1 Initialized")

class Base2:
    def __init__(self):
        self.str2 = "Base2"
        print("Base2 Initialized")

class Derived(Base1, Base2):
    def __init__(self):
        Base1.__init__(self)
        Base2.__init__(self)
        print("Derived Initialized")

d = Derived()
print(d.str1, d.str2)

#Output:
#Base1 Initialized
#Base2 Initialized
#Derived Initialized
#Base1 Base2

```
Note: Python uses the Method Resolution Order (MRO) to resolve which method or attribute is inherited in case of conflicts in multiple inheritance. You can view the MRO of a class using ClassName.__mro__.

#### 3.2 Method Resolution Order (MRO)
Python uses a specific order called MRO to determine the method lookup order in the presence of multiple inheritance.
Python uses the C3 Linearization algorithm to create the MRO.
You can see the MRO of any class using:

```python
print(Derived.__mro__)
```
Example:

```python

class A:
    def process(self):
        print("A process")

class B(A):
    def process(self):
        print("B process")

class C(A):
    def process(self):
        print("C process")

class D(B, C):
    pass

d = D()
d.process()
print(D.__mro__)
```
```
Output:
B process
(<class '__main__.D'>, <class '__main__.B'>, <class '__main__.C'>, <class '__main__.A'>, <class 'object'>)
```
#### 3.3 Mixin Classes
- Mixin classes are used to add reusable methods to a class, without using inheritance as the primary mechanism. They allow you to add functionality to classes in a more flexible way.

```python

class LogMixin:
    def log(self, message):
        print(f"LOG: {message}")

class Animal:
    pass

class Dog(Animal, LogMixin):
    def bark(self):
        self.log("Dog is barking!")

d = Dog()
d.bark()
```
#### 3.4 Metaclasses (Class of a Class)
- A metaclass is a class for classes. It defines how a class behaves. In Python, you can customize the behavior of class creation by defining a custom metaclass.
```python
class MyMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f"Creating class {name}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=MyMeta):
    pass
```

### 4. Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows different objects to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. In Python, this can be done using method overriding or by creating functions that can operate on objects of different classes.

```python
class Bird:
    def fly(self):
        print("Bird is flying.")

class Airplane:
    def fly(self):
        print("Airplane is flying.")

def make_it_fly(entity):
    entity.fly()

bird = Bird()
plane = Airplane()
make_it_fly(bird)  # Output: Bird is flying.
make_it_fly(plane)  # Output: Airplane is flying.
```

### 5. Abstraction

Abstraction hides the internal implementation of a method and exposes only the necessary functionality. In Python, this can be achieved using abstract base classes.

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

rect = Rectangle(10, 20)
print(rect.area())  # Output: 200
```

---

## Python OOP Examples

1. **Creating a Class and Object**:
   ```python
   class Person:
       def __init__(self, name, age):
           self.name = name
           self.age = age

       def introduce(self):
           print(f"My name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")

   p = Person("John", 30)
   p.introduce()  # Output: My name is John and I am 30 years old.
   ```

2. **Inheritance Example**:
   ```python
   class Employee:
       def __init__(self, name, salary):
           self.name = name
           self.salary = salary

       def work(self):
           print(f"{self.name} is working.")

   class Manager(Employee):
       def __init__(self, name, salary, department):
           super().__init__(name, salary)
           self.department = department

       def work(self):
           print(f"{self.name} is managing the {self.department} department.")

   m = Manager("Alice", 80000, "HR")
   m.work()  # Output: Alice is managing the HR department.
   ```

---
## Summary:
These OOP concepts in Python help build efficient and flexible code. Key advanced topics include:

- Multiple inheritance and Method Resolution Order (MRO)
- Abstract classes, interfaces, and decorators like @property
- Static and class methods
- Encapsulation via protected/private members
- Operator overloading (dunder methods)
- Mixin classes for reusable functionality
- Metaclasses for customizing class creation
---

## Do's and Don'ts in OOP

### Do's:
1. **Encapsulate Data**: Keep attributes private or protected to avoid accidental modification.
   ```python
   self.__private_attr
   ```
   
2. **Use Descriptive Names**: Use meaningful names for classes, methods, and attributes.
   
3. **Promote Reusability**: Make use of inheritance to promote code reuse and reduce redundancy.

4. **Favor Composition over Inheritance**: If possible, use composition (has-a relationship) rather than inheritance (is-a relationship).

   ```python
   class Engine:
       def start(self):
           print("Engine started.")

   class Car:
       def __init__(self):
           self.engine = Engine()

       def start(self):
           self.engine.start()
   ```

### Don'ts:
1. **Avoid Long Classes**: Break down large classes into smaller, more manageable ones.
   
2. **Don’t Overuse Inheritance**: Too much inheritance can lead to complex, tightly coupled systems. Use it only when it makes sense.

3. **Avoid Exposing Internal States**: Don’t let external code directly modify internal states.
   
4. **Don’t Ignore Object Lifecycles**: Be mindful of how objects are created and destroyed.

## OOP Interview Questions: Tips and Tricks

### Common Interview Questions

1. **What is OOP, and how is it different from procedural programming?**
   - Answer by explaining the core concepts of OOP and how it allows for better code organization, modularity, and reusability.

2. **Explain the difference between encapsulation and abstraction.**
   - Encapsulation involves hiding data, while abstraction hides complexity by providing a simplified interface.

3. **What is polymorphism in Python? How is it achieved?**
   - Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

4. **How does Python handle inheritance and multiple inheritance?**
   - Explain single and multiple inheritance in Python, and how the method resolution order (MRO) works.

### Best Practices for Interviews

- **Understand the Basics**: Ensure you understand core OOP principles—encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- **Explain with Examples**: When asked about a concept, always back your answer with a simple code example.
- **Prepare to Discuss Edge Cases**: Interviewers often ask about edge cases or less common scenarios like multiple inheritance or method resolution order.
- **Code Neatly**: In live coding interviews, write clean, readable code with meaningful names for classes and methods.
- **Ask Clarifying Questions**: Before solving the problem, ensure you fully understand the requirements.
