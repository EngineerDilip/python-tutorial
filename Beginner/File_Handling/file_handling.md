## 1. What is File Handling?
File handling in Python refers to the ability to work with files—reading from them, writing to them, and performing other operations like renaming or deleting them. Python provides built-in functions to handle file operations such as:
- **Creating** files
- **Opening** files
- **Reading from** and **writing to** files
- **Closing** files after operations

---

## 2. Opening Files
To work with a file, the first step is to open it using the `open()` function. The `open()` function returns a file object and requires two arguments: the file name and the mode (optional).

**Syntax**:
```python
file_object = open('filename', 'mode')
```


| **Argument** | **Description** |
|-----------|--------------------|
|filename	|The name of the file (can include the path)|
|mode	|Specifies the purpose of opening the file (e.g., reading, writing, appending)|


## 3. File Modes

Python allows you to open files in different modes depending on the task you want to perform.

| **Mode** | **Description** |
|----------|-----------------|
| 'r'	| Open for reading (default mode). Raises an error if the file does not exist. |
| 'w'	| Open for writing. Overwrites the file if it exists. Creates a new file if it doesn’t. |
| 'a'	| Open for appending. Data is added to the end of the file. Creates a new file if it doesn’t exist. |
| 'b'	| Open in binary mode (used with other modes, e.g., 'rb', 'wb'). |
| 'x'	| Open for exclusive creation. Fails if the file already exists. |
| 't'	| Open in text mode (default mode). |
| '+'	| Open for updating (reading and writing). |


Example:
```python
# Open a file for reading
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
```

## 4. Reading Files
Python provides various methods to read from a file.

|**Method**|**Description**	|**Example**|**Result**|
|----------|----------------|-----------|-----------|
|read(size)	|Reads the entire file or specified number of bytes	|file.read(10)|	Reads first 10 characters|
|readline()|	Reads one line at a time|	file.readline()	|Reads a single line|
|readlines()	|Reads the entire file and returns a list of lines	|file.readlines()	|Returns a list of all lines|


Example
```python
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
content = file.read()  # Reads the entire content
print(content)
file.close()
```

## 5. Writing to Files
Python allows writing text or binary data to files using the following methods.

|**Method**|**Description**|**Example**|
|----------|---------------|------------|
|write()|Writes a string or binary data to the file	file.|write('Hello, World!')|
|writelines()|	Writes a list of strings to the file|	file.writelines(['Hello\n', 'World\n'])|

Example:

```python
Copy code
file = open('example.txt', 'w')
file.write('This is a test.')
file.close()
```

## 6. Closing Files
It is important to close a file after finishing the operations to free up system resources.

```python
file.close()
```
Alternatively, use the with statement (recommended), which automatically closes the file.

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
```

## 7. File Pointers and Seeking

The file object has a pointer that tracks the position in the file. You can manipulate the file pointer using seek() and get the current position using tell().

|**Method**|**Description**|**Example**|
|----------|---------------|-----------|
|seek(offset, whence)|	Moves the file pointer to a specific position|	file.seek(0) moves to the beginning|
|tell()|Returns the current position of the file pointer	|file.tell()|


## 8. File Iteration
You can iterate over a file object to read each line one by one.

```python

with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line, end='')
```

## 9. With Statement
Using the with statement is a best practice in Python file handling as it ensures that the file is automatically closed after the block of code is executed.

```python

with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
# The file is automatically closed here
```

## 10. Handling Exceptions in File Operations
It’s essential to handle errors that might occur during file operations. You can use try-except blocks for error handling.

```python

try:
    file = open('non_existent_file.txt', 'r')
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found.")
finally:
    if file:
        file.close()
```

## 11. Working with Binary Files
Binary files are used to store non-text data like images, videos, or executables. Open a file in binary mode ('b').

```python

# Reading a binary file
with open('image.jpg', 'rb') as file:
    binary_data = file.read()

# Writing binary data
with open('output.jpg', 'wb') as file:
    file.write(binary_data)
```

## 12. Deleting, Renaming, and Checking Files
Python provides the os and os.path modules to perform file operations like deleting, renaming, and checking file existence.

|**Operation**|	**Description**|**Example**|
|-------------|----------------|------------|
|os.remove()|	Deletes a file	|os.remove('file.txt')|
|os.rename()|	Renames a file	|os.rename('old.txt', 'new.txt')|
|os.path.exists()|	Checks if a file exists	os.path.|exists('file.txt')|

## 13. Working with Directories
The os module also provides functions to work with directories.

|**Method**|**Description**|**Example**|
|----------|----------------|-----------|
|os.mkdir()	|Creates a new directory|	os.mkdir('new_dir')|
|os.rmdir()	|Removes an empty directory| os.rmdir('new_dir')|
|os.listdir()|	Lists all files in a directory|	os.listdir('.')|
|os.chdir()|	Changes the current working directory|	os.chdir('/path/to/directory')|


## 14. File Encoding
You can specify a file's encoding when opening it, especially useful for reading and writing non-ASCII characters.

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    content = file.read()
```

## 15. Common Mistakes in File Handling
- Not closing the file after opening it.
- Using the wrong mode (e.g., trying to write to a file opened in read mode).
- Assuming file paths are always relative (use absolute paths for clarity).
- Not handling file exceptions (like missing files or permission errors).

## 16. Best Practices for File Handling
- Always use the with statement to ensure proper closure of files.
- Handle possible exceptions such as FileNotFoundError and IOError.
- Use relative paths to keep your code portable, but ensure you know the working directory.
- Specify the encoding when working with text files, especially when dealing with non-ASCII characters.
