# Python Tuples: Comprehensive Overview (A to Z)

Tuples in Python are **immutable**, ordered collections of items. They are defined by placing items inside parentheses `()`, separated by commas. Because they are immutable, once a tuple is created, you cannot change, modify, or add elements to it, unlike lists.

## 1. What is a Tuple?
- A **tuple** is an ordered collection of elements, just like a list. However, unlike lists, **tuples are immutable**, meaning once created, their contents cannot be altered.
- Example of a tuple: `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`

**Key Points:**
- Tuples are **immutable**: You cannot change their values once assigned.
- They are **ordered**: Elements are stored in a specific order.
- **Duplicates allowed**: A tuple can have duplicate elements.
  
## 2. Creating Tuples
Tuples can be created using parentheses `()` and separating elements by commas.

```python
# Empty tuple
empty_tuple = ()

# Tuple with one element (comma is required for a single element tuple)
single_element_tuple = (1,)

# Tuple with multiple elements
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, "apple", True)
```

## 3. Tuple Operations

| **Operation**      | **Description**                                  | **Example**                  | **Result**                          |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Concatenation**   | Combine two tuples                              | `(1, 2) + (3, 4)`            | `(1, 2, 3, 4)`                     |
| **Repetition**      | Repeat a tuple multiple times                   | `(1, 2) * 3`                 | `(1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)`               |
| **Membership**      | Check if an element is present in the tuple     | `2 in (1, 2, 3)`             | `True`                             |
| **Length**          | Get the number of elements in the tuple         | `len((1, 2, 3))`             | `3`                                |
| **Indexing**        | Access element by index                         | `(1, 2, 3)[1]`               | `2`                                |
| **Negative Indexing**| Access elements from the end                   | `(1, 2, 3)[-1]`              | `3`                                |
| **Slicing**         | Get a portion of the tuple using slicing        | `(1, 2, 3, 4)[1:3]`          | `(2, 3)`                           |
| **Count**           | Count occurrences of a specific value           | `(1, 2, 2, 3).count(2)`      | `2`                                |
| **Index**           | Find the index of the first occurrence of a value| `(1, 2, 3).index(2)`         | `1`                                |
| **Unpacking**       | Assign tuple elements to variables              | `a, b = (1, 2)`              | `a=1, b=2`                         |
| **Tuple Creation**  | Create a tuple from an iterable                 | `tuple([1, 2, 3])`           | `(1, 2, 3)`                        |
| **Immutability**    | Tuples cannot be modified after creation        | `(1, 2)[0] = 5`              | Raises `TypeError`                 |
| **Nested Tuples**   | Access elements in nested tuples                | `(1, (2, 3))[1][1]`          | `3`                                |
| **Packing**         | Pack multiple values into a tuple               | `t = 1, 2, 3`                | `t = (1, 2, 3)`                    |
| **Hashability**     | Tuples can be used as dictionary keys           | `{(1, 2): "value"}`          | `{(1, 2): "value"}`                |
